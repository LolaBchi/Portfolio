            <div class="text-center mb-5">
                <p>Coming from a coastal town in France, I've always been passionate about Life Sciences. At 18 years old, I decided to move to Paris for my studies, where I pursued a bachelor's degree in Cell Biology and Physiology, followed by a research master's in Pathophysiology, specializing in Nutrition and Metabolism. Driven by my innate curiosity and a desire for a pluridisciplinary field of research, I found my first job as a biology engineer in an academic laboratory focused on Respiratory Neurophysiology, where I worked for three years.</p>
                <p>In mid-2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic and facing limited exciting opportunities in the academic sector, I decided to expand my knowledge with a Master of Science in Biotechnology. I chose a school in the Paris suburbs that specializes in dual-skill approaches, which perfectly aligned with my goal of gaining knowledge and skills from a business perspective. Alongside a broad range of courses, I secured an internship at Leyton, a consultancy firm that provides business performance services across various industries. There, I worked as a Tax Credit consultant in the Innovation Business Unit.</p>
                <p>At the end of my contract, I was uncertain about continuing in this career path. I felt utterly lost and my anxiety was at its peak, unable to determine my future direction. I needed time to reflect and bridge the gap between my pessimistic outlook and the world's potential for growth. Sometimes, itâ€™s essential to update ourselves to keep up with our changing reality. Since then, I've used my time off wisely, building a resilient mindset and enriching my skill set. Progressively expanding my vision and awareness about myself and the world. </p>
                <p>As I explored the interconnected fields of the food system, disruptive technologies, and human nature through books, podcasts and online courses, I gained a clear understanding of the challenges and opportunities our world faces. What a time to be alive!</p>

                <p class="skill-description">
                    My scientific training in biology and three years of experience working in a research lab have helped me develop a structured and thorough methodology to approach problems. As lead engineer for a COVID project, I'm accustomed to biosafety protocols and working in restrictive and highly regulated environments. Moreover, my time at Leyton gave me a solid understanding of the developmental and innovative challenges industries face before launching products to market.<br><br>
                    I genuinely believe that I maximized the potential of my career break, and I'm convinced it has given me a distinct advantage. One of the first things Iâ€™ve done was immersing myself in English content. I had been avoiding English for years, despite knowing its value for my career ambitions. I was determined to overcome this barrier and I am now fluent in English.<br><br>
                    During this time, I also addressed personal unresolved issues and adopted a daily meditation practice. Deep meditation yielded numerous benefits, particularly in enhancing emotional intelligence. By exploring my own emotions, I significantly improved my empathy and my ability to recognize and respond to others' emotional states. <br><br>
                    Leveraging AI for research, ideation, and learning has sharpened my ability to process and synthesize information efficiently. Moreover, using AI to code my portfolio website has enhanced my understanding of human-AI collaboration, boosting my technical skills and adaptability in an evolving workplace.<br><br>
                    Ultimately, these experiences have not only broadened my skill set but also fostered a forward-thinking mindset, and improved my mental clarity and self-confidence. I feel prepared to embrace new challenges. I am eager to dedicate my work to an impactful project.

                                Subsequently, I transitioned to a project investigating the effects of COVID-19 on central respiratory control. As the lead engineer, I studied the virus's impact on brainstem respiratory function using infected mice in controlled environments. My responsibilities encompassed the entire experimental process: from infecting the mice and recording their daily respiratory profiles using plethysmography to performing euthanasia when necessary. I also oversaw the ethical aspects of the project, including humane euthanasia and organ collection for further analysis.
                                <br><br><b>First Project:</b>

                                I worked on Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS), a rare genetic condition that impairs the body's ability to sense high levels of carbon dioxide. With no available pharmacological treatments, my focus was on exploring how different drugs, used alone or in combination, could improve respiratory function in a mouse model of CCHS. This involved testing these drugs on brainstem preparations from the mice and managing the upkeep of the mutant mouse line.

                                I worked on a study investigating how a high-protein diet (HPD) in male rats influences the metabolic health of their offspring through epigenetic mechanisms.
